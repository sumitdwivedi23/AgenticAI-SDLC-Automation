# 🛠️ End-to-End Automated Software Development Life Cycle 🚀

## **Overview**
This project aims to automate the **entire Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** with **minimal human intervention** using **Agentic AI, LangGraph, and Groq**. From **requirement gathering to deployment and QA testing**, this system enables AI-driven automation for software creation, testing, and optimization.

## **📌 Example Requirement**

### **Functional Requirements**  
- The software should be a web-based calculator that allows users to perform addition of two numbers.  
- Users should be able to input two numbers, which can be positive or negative integers.  
- Upon clicking a "Calculate" button, the software should display the sum of the two numbers.  

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
- The web application should be accessible from modern web browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).  
- The user interface should be simple and intuitive, with clear labels for input fields and buttons.  

### **Constraints**  
- The calculator should only handle integer addition for this version.  
- No need for user authentication or data persistence.
